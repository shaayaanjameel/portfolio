title: 300 WMG
sub: Elite training provided in Ottawa, Ontario
intro: '<strong>300 WMG</strong> is a professional fitness company that provides its clients with elite training. I was given the opportunity to brand the company.'
  
process-sub1: To help brand the company 
process-desc1: The goal behind this project was to help brand 300 WMG (World Management Group). The company was going for a strong Spartan kind of feel.   

process-sub2: Research and sketches
process-desc2: The client provided me with a general idea as to where they wanted me to take their company, this helped me a lot when it came time for me to research. I follow the same process almost everytime I start a new project. I begin with mind mapping, then research and then I sketch.

process-sub3: Great client    
process-desc3: Luckily I was blessed with a great client. They were easy to work with and very understanding. It was the first time I came across a situation in which I felt like I had no challenges.   

process-sub4: 300 Stallion    
process-desc4: After sketching and showing my client the options and then making some changes I was able to produce a logo that my client was happy with. They really liked it and felt like I captured what they were going for.
