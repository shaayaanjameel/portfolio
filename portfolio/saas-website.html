title: 4Ever Fit
sub: A responsive fitness service website
intro: '<strong>4Ever Fit</strong> is a responsive SAAS website completed as an inclass assignment. The service provided by this website is a fitness service that helps users stay in shape and keep track of themselves. To view the original page please visit the <a href="http://shaayaanjameel.github.io/saas-website/">4Ever Fit</a> website.' 
  
process-sub1: Creating a fictional service website 
process-desc1: 'The idea behind this project was to create a multi-page website selling a fictional service. The three pages that we were required to build were: a main page, a pricing page and a sign-up page.'

process-sub2: Research and sketches
process-desc2: When designing my website I started off with mind-mapping. This helped me think of topics and items that would be useful to have on my website. I wrote down anything and everything that popped up into my head regarding fitness. I created a moodboard to help me get a feel as to what direction I should go design wise and then I started prototyping.

process-sub3: Responsive layout  
process-desc3: This website was the first responsive website I coded from scratch. It was challenging for me because I wasn't sure what the best approach was. I wasn't sure if I should start off coding for a big screen and then going down or vise versa.    

process-sub4: Trial and error     
process-desc4: When I started coding my website I started designing for a large screen layout. I would alternate between my screen sizes as I was coding because I wanted to see what it looked like on all sizes. I soon came to realize that it was smarter and more efficient for me to design for a small screen first and move my way up once I had successfully tackled that.
