title: Paw Tracker
sub: A mobile app design for the ultimate Zoo experience 
intro: '<strong>Paw Tracker</strong> is a Mobile App that was desgined for an inclass assignment. This app is the prefect app for zoo-goers. It helps you search events and animals and the interactive map can help point you in the right directions towards your destination.'

process-sub1: An app design that would be helpful for frequent users
process-desc1: The idea behind this project was to select from a list of topics chosen by a fellow classmate and design for Android. The topic I chose was an app that was meant to be used as a navigation/informational tool at the Zoo.     

process-sub2: Research, sketches and user testing
process-desc2: This project was a little different. The research portion was already done by my fellow classmate and I had to take all of that information and design an app based off of that. Never having done anything like this before was interesting. Although the research was done I did some more research just for myself. After going over the notes I began prototyping and user testing.

process-sub3: Designing for Android 
process-desc3: The most challenging part of this project was designing for Android. It was the first time I was required to design for Android, it was like a whole new world. It's nothing like designing for iOS. I felt restricted and I wasn't use to that. Even though it was challenging it was a nice change and a great learning experience.   

process-sub4: Google Material Guidelines   
process-desc4: The Google Materials Guideline was a life saver. If it wasn't for that I would definitely be lost. Although I was not used to the Android restrictions the guideline is actually the only reason I was able to follow the restrictions properly. Having access to limited colour and design choices was different but the guideline did such a good job and giving all the necessary information that even though I was restricted I felt like I had accomplished and learned something new.
