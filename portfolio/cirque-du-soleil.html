title: Cirque Du Soleil 
intro: '<em>Cirque Du Soleil</em> is a series of illustrated portraits made representing different acrobats. This series started off as being part of a class assignment during my second year in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College but I then later decided to turn it into a personal project and create more illustrations using the same style.'
caption: 'This is one of my favourite pieces from the entire <strong>Circlist Portrait</strong> series.'
