title: Who Gives a Hoot
sub: A series of Uloo-strations 
intro: '<strong>Who Gives A Hoot</strong> is a series of <em>Uloo</em>-strations (owl in urdu). Each month Hoot, the owl, takes on a new character/theme. Every month represents an event or season for that time period. The platform the owl is designed for changes based on the theme of the month. This project is currently a WIP and will be completed by the end of December 2016.

process-sub1: Owl illustrations
process-desc1: This project started as an in class t-shirt design assignment. Once I completed the assignment I had an obsession with owls and decided that I was going to start a personal project based off of them. The idea behind this project was too design an owl every month for two years with a different theme. 

process-sub2: Research and sketches 
process-desc2: When designing the owls I wanted to make sure that each owl was unique in all forms. Eyes, mouth, nose, wings, body etc. In order to make sure that I was able to achieve that I researched all sorts of different owls, realistic and illustrative. Once I did my research I sketched different shapes I would like to use and owl layouts depending on the theme.

process-sub3: Finding the right feel and time management  
process-desc3: The most challenging part about this project was figuring out what the right theme/feel for the month was along with managing my time. There were a few months that had several options and figuring out which option was the best was tricky. At the same time because I was still in school finding the time to actually work on the owl each month became a big challenge for me, juggling the two was not easy.   

process-sub4: Designing for a variety of platforms  
process-desc4: When I started off this project I had set my mind to making all my designs t-shirt desings. As I started researching and coming up with ideas for each month I slowly started to realize that not all the themes would work well as t-shirt designs, I needed to expand my horizon. I picked themes based on significant events during the month and personal preference. This helped me expand my platform horizon. Time management became tricky, there were times where I had to delay my designs and give greater importance to the right task.
