intro: '<em>Luna Cafe</em> is a web based assignment that I completed in my second year at Algonquin College. The idea behind this assignment was to redesign a website for a restaurant and the restaurant I chose was Luna Cafe.'
caption: The idea behind the redesign for my website was to give the website a fruity and lively look and feel just like the cafe itself.
