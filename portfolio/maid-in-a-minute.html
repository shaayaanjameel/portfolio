title: Maid In A Minute
sub: The ideal organization app 
intro: '<strong>Maid In A Minute</strong> is a fictional Mobile App that was designed for an in class assignment. Maid In A Minute is an organization based app that was designed for everyday users.'

process-sub1: An app design that would be helpful for everyday users
process-desc1: The idea behind this project was to create/design an app that would be helpful for everyday users. I chose to design an organization app for maids/cleaners. The concept of this app could essentially be applied to anyone, whether it be a student or a an adult in their profession.  

process-sub2: Research, sketches and user testing
process-desc2: I started off this project by doing research and creating a moodboard. Once I had decided what direction I wasnted to go in design wise I started sketching prototypes and then ran a series of user testing.

process-sub3: Designing for one user 
process-desc3: The most challenging part about this assignment was designing for one user. When I was designing I kept wanted to design for the client and the service provider. It created a lot of confusion and made the app more complex then needed.  

process-sub4: Picking one user     
process-desc4: In the end I decided that I needed to stick to one user, either the client or the service provider. I picked the service provider. Picking just one user helped me simplify the app and make it a lot more user friendly.
