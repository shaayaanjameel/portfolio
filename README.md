Shaayaan Jameel, Ottawa based Graphic Designer

Realizing what your end destination is as a student isn't easy for everyone. Some students realize early in life while others realize later. I started my journey in postsecondary as business student and finished as a design student. I quickly realized is where I belonged. So here I am, just an average person, looking for a full-time design challenge.
